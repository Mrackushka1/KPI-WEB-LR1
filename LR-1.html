            <p><strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> is the creator of the 
            <em>Python programming language</em>. He grew up in the Netherlands 
            and studied at the University of Amsterdam, where he graduated 
            with a <em>Master's Degree</em> in <em>Mathematics and Computer Science</em>. 
            His first job after college was as a <em>programmer at CWI</em>, 
            where he worked on the <em>ABC language</em>, the Amoeba distributed 
            operating system, and a variety of multimedia projects. 
            During this time he created <em>Python</em> as side project. 
            He then moved to the United States to take a job at a 
            non-profit research lab in Virginia, married a Texan, 
            worked for several other startups, and moved to California. 
            In 2005 he joined Google, where he obtained the rank of 
            <em>Senior Staff Engineer</em>, and in 2013 he started working for 
            Dropbox as a <em>Principal Engineer</em>. In October 2019 he retired. 
            After a short retirement he joined Microsoft as <em>Distinguished 
            Engineer</em> in 2020. Until 2018 he was Python's <em>BDFL</em>
            (Benevolent Dictator For Life), and he is still deeply 
            involved in the Python community. Guido, his wife and their 
            teenager live in Silicon Valley, where they love hiking, 
            biking and birding.</p>
